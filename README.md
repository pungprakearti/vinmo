# VinMo!

VinMo! is a test web application that I made. It sends a request to an API and uses that data to dynamically create filters and ecommerce items on a board. This was created in React and was deployed on Netlify.

You can try the live demo here:
<a href="https://affectionate-bose-d0e184.netlify.com/">https://affectionate-bose-d0e184.netlify.com/</a>

## Issues

In order to view the site, you have to allow unsafe scripts to load in Chrome. The reasoning behind this is because deploying on Netlify hosts the site on "https."

The API is hosted on "http."

When a request is made from "https" to "http" it is deemed unsafe because of "Mixed Content."

The workaround for this is to click on the shield on the right of the toolbar and then to click on "Load Unsafe Scripts" in the dialog box that follows.

There is no workaround for this on mobile, so instead, I just locally saved the API response and have that load ONLY for mobile so that people can experience the site on mobile.

## Boiler Plate create-react-app stuff below

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
